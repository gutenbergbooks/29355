<div class="bk1"><p><i><small>This story may, in a sense, be tongue-in-cheek. But the underlying struggle,
if you look into the characters' hearts, is terrifyingly real and human&mdash;the
kind of struggle so many of us go through. But Sam Meecham was lucky.
He not only got what he wanted, but something he hadn't realized he wanted.</small></i></p></div>

<h2><small><i>by ... Charles E. Fritch</i></small></h2>

<p class="pr1"><big><b>Sam Meecham did not realize that his chance discovery of unlimited
power would bring back that which he had lost eight long years ago.</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">To look</span> at Sam Meecham
you'd never have dreamed he was
a man of decision and potential
explorer of the unknown. In fact,
there were times when Sam
wouldn't either. He was a pink,
frail-looking person with a weak
chin and shoulders used to stooping,
and stereotyped thinking immediately
relegated him to the
ranks of the meek and mannerly.
These, oddly enough, happened
to be his characteristics&mdash;but that
was before he discovered the
hyperdrive.</p>

<p>In his capacity as an atomic
engine inspector, his work was
most uncreative. He was a small
cog in a large cog-laden machine.
A government worker helping to
produce engines that would send
supplies and immigrants and tourists
to the U.S. Sector of the
Moon Colony.</p>

<p>Day after day, week after week,
freshly made engines would come
sliding down the conveyor belt.
And mechanically Sam Meecham
would attach to each two wires
that led from a machine by his
side, flip a switch, and if the dial
on his machine read at least fifty,
he could pass the machine on as
being adequate for the job of
Moon ferry. He'd been attaching
those two wires in place and
watching fifties for five years, and
it looked as though he'd be doing
it for fifty-five more.</p>

<p>Then one day a defectively
wired machine came sliding along,
and dutifully Sam hooked it up
and flipped the switch. Automatically,
his eyes glanced disinterestedly
at the dial showing
Comparative Thrust. His eyes
bugged. The needle had passed
fifty, had gone to the 100 mark
(never before reached), struck
the metal projection, bent, and
was whirling in a rapid circle!</p>

<p>Sam quickly cut off the motor,
then he glanced furtively about to
see if anyone had noticed. The
room was a flurry of men busy at
routine tasks and none of them
seemed particularly interested in
anything that was going on at his
table.</p>

<p>Sam checked his own machine
and found the tester in perfect
working order. He hesitated a
brief moment, then flipped the
switch again. He was prepared
for the whir of the dial now but
still it frightened him a little.
There must be something wrong;
no atomic engine could have that
much Comparative Thrust. Yet&mdash;the
tester was perfect.</p>

<p>Sam Meecham shut off the
tester and stood very still for a
minute and thought about it. His
glance fell on the intricate wiring
within the atomic engine and he
saw with a start that it looked
different from usual. Wires were
where wires had never been before,
where wires were not supposed
to be.</p>

<p>With another quick glance
about him Sam began copying the
wiring pattern on a sheet of paper.
He thrust the paper into his
pocket as the foreman came up
to him.</p>

<p>"Say, Meecham," the foreman
said, "that last engine okay?"</p>

<p>Sam Meecham hesitated briefly,
then said, "The wiring was a little
fouled up. Busted the dial on the
tester."</p>

<p>The foreman shook his head.
"I was afraid of that. Some wireman
on the third floor came in
half drunk a few minutes ago.
That was only his first machine, so
the others ought to be okay." He
jabbed a finger at the engine.
"You'd better send it back up."</p>

<p>When the foreman was gone
Sam checked the wiring with his
diagram to make certain he hadn't
made any mistakes, and then he
disconnected some of the wires&mdash;just
in case.</p>

<p>For the first time in years Sam
Meecham felt a new freedom.
He'd always been a dreamer hampered
by cold reality&mdash;a man
with his head in the stars and his
feet chained to solid earth. He'd
wanted to go to the Moon when
the government first started colonizing;
but Dorothy, his wife,
talked him out of it.</p>

<p>At various times he had felt
that secret longing, that beckoning
of the stars, but each time he
had shelved the desire and turned
to attaching his two wires of the
tester to their proper terminals
on each atomic engine, and then
when his shift was up he turned
homeward to face an existence
equally uninspiring.</p>

<p>The moment he had seen that
needle pass into the hundreds,
Sam Meecham knew what he was
going to do. He had planned it
years ago, when he first stood
alone in the night and gazed upward
at the glittering diamonds
that lay beyond reach. Even then
he had known what he would do
if ever the opportunity presented
itself. In those moments of self-pity
that came too often, however,
he had told himself that it
was only wishful thinking and
cursed himself for being a weakling
and a dreamer who did nothing
about his dreams. But he had
resolved that someday he <i>would</i>
go out among the stars.</p>

<p>That day had come, and as Sam
Meecham went homeward that
evening he felt his heart beat in
time with the pulsing light of the
stars overhead. But with this new
exultation he felt a desperate fear.
A fear that he might again bypass
his opportunity as he had done so
often before. Yet he knew that
this was his greatest chance, perhaps
his last chance. He must be
brave and strong, and above all
confident that his intense longing
would make his venture successful.</p>

<p>"How did everything go?"
Dorothy asked when he came in.</p>

<p>It was a mechanical question
and he answered it mechanically,
"Okay. Everything went as usual."</p>

<p>He didn't want to look at her.
She had grown plump since they
had married eight years ago, and
by not looking at her he could
somehow pretend she was still
slim and attractive.</p>

<p>She was lying on a couch, wearing
a housecoat, and didn't look
up from the magazine in front
of her. "Supper's on the table,"
she said.</p>

<p>For eight years he'd had flat,
uninspiring meals, meals that kept
one from starving and no more.
His complaints had met with more
hostility than he cared to cope
with, and always, meekly he had
retired from the scene of battle
wishing he had submitted and
thus avoided the tongue-lashing
before which he felt so helpless.</p>

<p>Once more in the surroundings
that bred it, a familiar, distasteful
helplessness rose to envelop Sam
Meecham. It came across him as
a feeling of despair and bewilderment,
and he wondered sickly if
he would ever escape this.</p>

<p><i>Yes</i>, he told himself, clenching
his fists determinedly. But he
would have to bide his time.
Slowly, not really tasting it, he
ate the cold, uninviting meal set
on the table.</p>

<p>Securing the engine was the
least of his worries&mdash;at least from
a commercial standpoint. The
factory was turning out atomic
engines at almost production-line
rates, and civilians could easily
get them for private use&mdash;so long
as they operated them at low
speeds and within the atmosphere
of Earth.</p>

<p>That last thought drew a long
secret laugh from Sam Meecham.
At low speeds. The government
considered anything above a 50
CT as high speed. And here he
was with a secret that could enable
him to travel at&mdash;who knows what
speeds? He could give it to the
government later, but right now
he had his own use for it.</p>

<p>Dorothy would prove an obstacle,
however. She always was
an obstacle, and there was no
reason to assume she wouldn't
be one now. And he was right
about that. The following payday,
when he took his check and
splurged it on an atomic engine,
Dorothy was madder than a
Uranium pile approaching critical
mass.</p>

<p>"Here I scrimp and save on
that measly paycheck you bring
home," she wailed, "and you go
out and buy luxuries we don't
need if we could afford them.
Look at this dress! It's old&mdash;all
my clothes are old. And you
know why? You want to know
why?"</p>

<p>Sam Meecham already knew
why. It was because as a manager
of his financial affairs Dorothy
was a flop. Often he had wanted
to tell her so, but the more times
he attempted to open his mouth
the louder she had wailed. It
was a lot easier just to let her
explode and then fizzle out. Even
now he had the desire to shout
at her to see what would happen.
But her shrieks made him grow
sullen and unsure of himself. Perhaps
he <i>had</i> wasted the money.
After all, the engine they had in
their outdated model rocket was
good for a few years more. But
for a long trip through space&mdash;it
would never do.</p>

<p>The explosion was over and she
was merely sizzling. She had
folded her arms resolutely, determined
that he should cancel
the order for the engine immediately.</p>

<p>Sam Meecham felt a wave of
helplessness surge over him. He
felt lost and bewildered. Perhaps
she was right; maybe it <i>was</i> foolish.
Here he was: Sam Meecham,
thirty-five, whose mediocre living
was made attaching two wires to
two terminals day after day, week
after week&mdash;a man who suddenly
saw a pointer go unexpectedly
beyond the fifty mark, and who
immediately began having delusions
of grandeur. He was a
dreamer&mdash;but dreams and reality
were two different things, and
sometimes he confused them. He
shook his head, feeling like a
fool.</p>

<p>"Well?" Dorothy's face was before
him, determined, demanding.</p>

<p>Sam said, "All right, I'll take
it back."</p>

<p>She smiled condescendingly,
like a mother does when a child
admits a wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Conditioned responses, Sam
thought bitterly; that was the
whole trouble. This cravenness,
this kowtowing before any idiot
with a louder voice, certainly
wasn't in his genes. The trouble
was in his conditioning, started
when he was an adolescent. Give
somebody an inch and they'll take
two. Pretty soon they're walking
all over you, and you've become
so used to it you don't complain.</p>

<p>He thought of his job, of the
eternal fitting of two wires in
place. He was a cog and nothing
more&mdash;a cog that could be replaced
as swiftly, as efficiently
as any part of an assembly-line
atomic engine could be replaced.
He looked up into the blank, smiling,
self-satisfied face of his wife.
He thought of the stars beckoning
overhead. The <i>stars</i>!</p>

<p>"No," he said suddenly, decisively.
The word fell like a
sledgehammer blow in the stillness
of the room.</p>

<p>Dorothy's vacuous smile faded,
uncomprehending. "What?"</p>

<p>"No," Sam said, trying to keep
his voice even. "I've changed my
mind. I'm keeping the engine
whether you like it or not."</p>

<p>Dorothy's mouth hung open in
surprise, and before she could
recover enough to launch a fresh
tirade Sam Meecham had walked
out, slamming the door behind
him. He paused in the cool evening
and gazed upward. The
government had gone only to the
Moon. Sam Meecham was going
to the stars!</p>

<p>The next day he was given the
silent treatment. It had begun the
night before when he returned
from his walk. Dorothy was in
bed, awake and sniffling over the
cruelty inflicted upon her by an
unthoughtful husband, and when
he came in she turned her back
and wouldn't speak. Sam didn't
mind that; in fact, it was a welcome
relief. But all night long
she sniffled into her pillow, trying
to win him over.</p>

<p>Sam felt an odd mixture of
sympathy and anger. "Oh, shut
up," he said finally, and stuck his
head under the pillow.</p>

<p>In the morning the treatment
continued, but it was not totally
silent&mdash;for Dorothy's air of hostility
was now accompanied by
low, sometimes indistinct mumblings.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sam said, "This
coffee's cold."</p>

<p>"If you don't like it," Dorothy
said, and thrust her face near his,
"make some yourself."</p>

<p>Sam half-rose and gripped the
table. "Look, my lovely one, <i>I'm</i>
the gent who brings home that
weekly paycheck you can't get
along without. Measly or not, it's
good, honest American dough that
lets us live a little decently&mdash;and
the least <i>you</i> could do is give me
warm coffee in the morning!"</p>

<p>His voice had risen almost to a
shout and Sam himself was
surprised at it. Dorothy's eyebrows
crept into a bewildered
frown, and like one in a trance
she moved to turn on the heat
beneath the coffee pot.</p>

<p>Sam's heart was beating swiftly
as he sat down. Conditioned responses,
he thought a little wildly.
He'd started it off last night
by defying Dorothy&mdash;and now,
bit by bit, it was becoming easier.
All he'd have to do was keep it
up, see that he didn't lapse.</p>

<p>He sipped the coffee slowly, as
if tasting his recent triumph in the
black liquid.</p>

<p>"You'd better hurry," Dorothy
said, looking at him a little uneasily.</p>

<p>Sam glanced at the wall clock
and began gulping the hot liquid.
Ten of eight! He'd have to hurry.
He paused suddenly, the cup in
mid-air, and wondered. Hurry to
what? To those two wires and
the tester and the endless stream
of untested engines flowing
toward him?</p>

<p>With an infinite firmness, Sam
Meecham placed his cup on the
saucer. "I'm not going in," he
said.</p>

<p>Dorothy looked at him as
though he were crazy. "What do
you mean, you're not going in?"
she demanded. "Just because
you've got some mulish notion in
your head, do you think we have
to starve? You're going in and
liking it."</p>

<p>"The engine I bought is coming
today," he said in a quiet voice.
"I want to install it." In Sam
Meecham's eyes there was a
deadly fire that even his wife had
not seen before. She gulped and
backed away a little.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Call up the foreman," Sam
said. "Tell him I'm sick. No,
wait." He paused, smiling coldly.
That would leave him an out; he
could always go back to the job
if he changed his mind. He said
slowly, "Tell him I've quit."</p>

<p>"<i>Sam!</i>"</p>

<p>"Tell him I've quit," Sam insisted.
That was the thing. Burn
your bridges behind you so you
can't turn back, so the only road
is ahead.</p>

<p>Sam Meecham was going to the
stars, and he would never return!</p>

<p>The atomic engine came that
afternoon, neat and shiny and
sleek, with all the wires in
their proper places, checked
and double-checked by a sober
human cog in the prison from
which Sam Meecham had just
escaped.</p>

<p>Sam busied himself in the
hangar, lifting out the old engine
and replacing it with the new one.
Carefully, he settled it into its
housing and bolted it down. Then
he rearranged the wires into the
pattern outlined on the sheet of
paper.</p>

<p>Dorothy brought him coffee.
That surprised him but he accepted
it gratefully.</p>

<p>"Can&mdash;can I help you, Sam?"
she offered.</p>

<p>He looked at her, perhaps a
little disappointed that her face
was serious. He said, "Sure you're
not just trying to be nosey?"</p>

<p>A sharp pain darted into her
eyes and she turned away.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said.</p>

<p>He called himself a fool. It
was another of her tricks and he
was falling for it. He put a restraining
hand on her arm and
remembered another time eight
years ago when the touch would
have sent electric thrills coursing
through him. Oddly, he felt a
small remnant of the pleasure stir
within him.</p>

<p>"All right," he said gruffly.
"All right, you can help."</p>

<p>So he was a fool. He'd been a
fool before and chances were he'd
be one again more often than he'd
care to admit. In a short while,
hours perhaps, he'd be gone&mdash;and
he'd never see Dorothy again.
Somehow the thought was not as
comforting as he had expected,
and he tried to work off a lingering
doubt that rose to plague him.</p>

<p>They worked through the afternoon,
testing any weak parts the
rocket might have, bracing the
struts, checking for leaks. Sam
found two space-suits in the
locker. He'd better leave one, he
thought. They were expensive
and Dorothy might need one
sometime. With him gone, she
couldn't afford to throw money
around. Yet he might need it
more than she ever would. For a
minute he stood undecided, and
then he put them both in the
locker.</p>

<p>Dorothy came into the room
and smiled wearily at him. "It'll
go any place now," she told him
proudly.</p>

<p>In her eyes Sam saw an indefinable
something. Something
he might have seen eight years
ago&mdash;but mixed with it was a
sadness he had not known she
could possess. Guiltily, he turned
his gaze away.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we'd better go in and
eat," he said, looking at his watch
without seeing it.</p>

<p>She didn't say anything, and
that was odd. Sam wished she
would nag and complain as she
always had before. He wondered
why he wished that, when only a
short time before he had wanted
just the opposite. It was with a
start that he realized the reason.
He was running away. That was
it. He was running away, and he
wanted to be deathly certain that
he had good cause to run. Slowly
the suspicion was creeping over
him that the situation had changed
slightly, was changing more.</p>

<p>He would leave tonight, he told
himself, before he weakened
enough to shelve his plans for
another comfortable rut.</p>

<p>Sam's voice was a little hoarse.
"What are you doing here? What
do you want?" He had finished
loading enough supplies aboard
the rocket to last him months.</p>

<p>Dorothy came toward him from
the darkness.</p>

<p>"It's no use," he said. "You
can't talk me out of it this time."</p>

<p>But she only smiled sadly and
said, "I know that, Sam. I came
to say good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye?"</p>

<p>"You're leaving, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes." He looked at the
ground, studying the darkness.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Sam," she said.
"We started out wrong. Maybe,
if we tried again&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Sam said quickly, "No.
I'm sorry too, but people don't
change."</p>

<p>The remark startled him. He
had used it occasionally to rationalize
his position, had been convinced
of its undeniable truth&mdash;yet
suddenly he realized that he
himself was its living denial.
People <i>could</i> change, just as he
had changed, just as Dorothy
could change. It had been partly
his fault when he first gave in to
something he didn't want to do,
and then to something else, and
something else after that. He had
helped dig the rut in which he
had found himself, taking it for
granted just as Dorothy had taken
it for granted.</p>

<p>Her hair was soft in the same
moonlight that had shone eight
years before, and Sam Meecham
felt a desire that had been too
long unfulfilled.</p>

<p>"Dorothy, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hesitated. The decision
came hard to him, for much of
his life had been devoted to giving
in to the decisions of others. This
was the moment he had been waiting
for, and now at the last
moment he was uncertain.</p>

<p>He said suddenly, "Can you
pack a few things?"</p>

<p>"Sam&mdash;" Her voice in the
darkness was eager. Her hands
touched his. Soft hands.</p>

<p>"You'd better hurry," he told
her.</p>

<p>Sam watched her go to the
house, and doubts began to gnaw
at him. Was he going to destroy
his plans now at a whim? He felt
an impulse to get into the rocket
and leave without her&mdash;yet he
thought of the cold emptiness of
space and himself drifting through
alien worlds, alone, lonely. Perhaps
it was wrong but he couldn't
condemn her for something that
was partly his fault. He was trying
to become the person he once
might have been, and it was only
fair that she should have the same
chance.</p>

<p>Dorothy came hurrying back, a
suitcase in her hand, and there
was an eagerness about her that
pleased him. He helped her put
the suitcase on board.</p>

<p>"Dorothy&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice was soft and low.
"Yes, Sam?" Starlight danced in
her eyes.</p>

<p>He pulled her gently to him.
He kissed her, and that night eight
years ago came back, and in his
arms was the young eager bride
he had known, the one he loved.</p>

<p>Minutes later they rose on
wings of fire, in a slow upward
spiral that quickened painlessly.
Sam had not questioned the
hyperdrive. It had worked in the
factory and it would work here.
He watched the needle cross the
dial in a swift, steady movement.</p>

<p>Dorothy placed her hand in his.
"Where are we going, darling?"</p>

<p>Sam Meecham smiled at her,
confident that he had made the
most important decision in his
life. He pointed through the forward
window.</p>

<p>Ahead of them lay the stars.</p>
